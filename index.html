          <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the
            materials; or
          </li>
          <li>
            transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials
            on any other server.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
        restrictions and may be terminated by Magnify Technologies at any time.
        Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination
        of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your
        possession whether in electronic or printed format.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>

        Magnify Technologies makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and
        hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without
        limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness
        for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property
        or other violation of rights.

      In no event shall Magnify Technologies or its suppliers be liable for any
      damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
      profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or
      inability to use Employee Link, even if Magnify Technologies or a Magnify
      Technologies authorized representative has been notified orally or in
      writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do
      not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability
      for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply
      to you.

      typographical, or photographic errors. Magnify Technologies does not
